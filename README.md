ldare is game engine being developed from scratch for learning and practicing essential game development skills.
Each and every single feature is written from scratch with absolutely no third party code or libraries.

The project started as a game engine for creating games for the Ludum Dare Game jam, hence the (provisory) name.

# What can I do with it so far ?
 We are in a state where it is already possible to write small 2D games.
 Features include a fast sprite renderer (no fancy stuff yet), spritesheet support, joystick support.
 
 # What's coming up ?
